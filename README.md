Milestone 1: Trivia Game

This trivia game is designed so once you click on a button within the question you are responding to, you can not select any other button in that group. When you select the correct answer, the button turns green and updates the score by 1. When you select the wrong answer, the button turns red and it does not effect the score. To win, you need at least 5 points. If you lose, you can select the Start Over button to reload the page.

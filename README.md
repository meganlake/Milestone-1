Milestone 1: Trivia Game

Instructions: Select the answers you think are correct. You need 5 points to win. If you lose, click the Start Over button to restart the game.

In my code, I have a counter with a function to update the counter when you select a correct answer. Then it updates the score on the page itself. I also have a Start Over button that reloads the page when you click on it. For the answer buttons, when you select a wrong answer, the "wrong-answer" class is added to the button and it turns off the ability to click on the other buttons in that group. When the correct answer is clicked, the "correct-answer" class is added to the button and it also turns off the ability to click any other buttons in that group.

With more time, I'd like to make the site more mobile friendly. I was able to start but there are some more things I'd like to do with it. I would also like to add some sort of pop-up saying "You won" or "You lost."
